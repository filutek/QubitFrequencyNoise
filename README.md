# QubitFrequencyNoise
Code for generating samples and evaluating analytical figures of merit for the qubit frequency noise. This code is supplemental to the paper: "Characterizing low-frequency qubit noise" by F. Wudarski et. al [arXiv:2207.01740](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01740). This notebook allows to reconstruct results obtained in the paper.
